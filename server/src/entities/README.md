# Entities

## Adding a new entity
1. Create a file under `entities/` with format: `Entity.ts`
2.  To organize imports and connect the entity to the DB, add the new entity to the default and named export in [`entities/index.ts`](https://github.com/JohnVicke/grannskapet/blob/master/server/src/entities/index.ts)
